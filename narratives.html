                      <p class="des">The 1950s was a period of great creative energy, with inspiration arriving from
                        across the Atlantic and from Europe. This era marked the introduction of mass-produced
                        furniture, designed by professionals who combined functionality with a new aesthetic concept.
                        Foam rubber, wicker, plastic, and vinyl became flexible and incredible materials, allowing
                        designers to craft almost anything they imagined. These materials answered a society’s desire
                        for fresh colors, a new lifestyle, and greater comfort at lower prices.</p>
                      <p class="des"> This was also the decade when design became a recognized profession, leading to
                        the creation of iconic objects that would define an era and inspire generations to come.
                        Furniture like the Antropus Chair and the Leonardo Table by Castiglioni were not only functional
                        but also conveyed the spirit of innovation and simplicity that characterized the period. These
                        pieces remain emblematic of a style that prioritized both beauty and practicality, setting the
                        stage for the evolution of modern interior design.</p>

                      <p class="des">In the 1960s, Italian design was not limited to cars and motorcycles; innovation
                        was also taking place in everyday household items. Products like the television and washing
                        machine became symbols of the era's forward-thinking approach and reflected changing social
                        values. The Algol TV by Zanuso was more than just an appliance; like the radio before it, it
                        became a central fixture in post-war family life, bringing people together in a shared space and
                        contributing to the growth of social interactions and media culture.</p>
                      <p class="des">The gradual spread of the washing machine, represented by Gerenziani's Automatic,
                        played a pivotal role in promoting women’s emancipation and advancing gender equality in Italy
                        and around the world. Washing clothes, which had traditionally demanded hours of women’s time,
                        was now simplified, freeing women from this task and enabling them to enter the workforce and
                        engage more actively in public life. These appliances were not only innovations of convenience
                        but also symbols of progress and shifting cultural roles.</p>

                      <h2 class="title">The 1970s</h2>
                      <p class="des">The 1970s brought a shift toward more authentic, personalized, and expressive
                        design. Interiors became eclectic, filled with organic shapes, retro inspiration, and a spirit
                        of individuality that allowed for bold self-expression. Earthy tones and deep jewel hues
                        dominated the color palette, creating spaces that felt warm, inviting, and rooted in nature.
                        Shades of brown, mustard yellow, avocado green, and burnt orange infused interiors with a
                        laid-back yet vibrant energy. Objects like Castiglioni's Linda Sink and Colombo's Optic Clock
                        brought striking form and function into everyday life, while Colombo’s 626 Alogena lamp added a
                        pop of futuristic light to the home.</p>
                      <p class="des">During this time, furniture also became sculptural, as seen in Enzo Mari’s
                        Capitello table and the Shiva vase by Ettore Sottsass. These pieces blurred the line between art
                        and function, embracing unconventional forms that celebrated individuality. With designs like
                        Enzo Mari’s 16 Pesci and Day Night, the home became a canvas for personal expression, inviting
                        creativity and an unstructured style that defined the era.</p>

                      <h2 class="title">The 1980s</h2>
                      <p class="des">The 1980s were naturally inclined toward genre-blending, an era marked by pivotal
                        historical “breaks,” from the Chernobyl disaster to the protests at Tiananmen Square and the
                        fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Design followed this turbulent historical path, mirroring a
                        rebellious spirit with strikingly bold lines and an almost extreme creativity. Though often
                        considered stylistic hedonism, the era’s style was grounded in Post-Avant-Garde principles,
                        focusing on freedom of expression while remaining functional. This approach gave rise to designs
                        that became a coded form of visual communication, with abundant use of new, low-cost materials
                        and a social purpose: to allow individuals to express their identity through their aesthetic
                        choices.</p>
                      <p class="des">This was a time for daring, for reimagining the home and its spaces. Concepts like
                        the open-plan layout emerged, and kitchens transformed into peninsula-style setups. Pieces like
                        Sottsass’s Enorme telephone and M24 computer became symbols of this daring, while Zanuso’s
                        Carmencita coffee pot and Mari’s Tonietta chair linked modern living to the expressive nature of
                        this design wave. It was a decade of merging fashion with interiors, united by a strong common
                        thread: provocation.</p>

                      <h2 class="title">The 1990s</h2>
                      <p class="des">The 1990s marked the rise of the internet, widespread mass culture, and a return to
                        industrial production. Large chains began making design accessible to everyone, offering
                        attractive and functional pieces at affordable prices. This was the era of playful, lighthearted
                        objects, yet it also saw a resurgence of minimalism, with furniture that balanced durability
                        with a sense of lightness, where tactile quality became essential.</p>
                      <p class="des">Gone were the excesses and opulence of the '80s, replaced by clean, flexible lines
                        and adaptable forms. Key trends included Asian influences, an abundance of white in kitchen
                        spaces, carpeting, and an emerging concept of “open” spaces. Castiglioni’s Brera and Joy pieces
                        exemplified this shift, bringing sleek, streamlined designs into everyday homes. Additionally,
                        the “country chic” aesthetic gained popularity, mixing natural tones and rustic touches for a
                        comfortable, refined style.</p>
